  /**
    * Simple domain logic process for demo purposes. Always answers with "42" ;-)
    *
    * The process is comprised of two stages (aka steps or tasks). Each of these performs its work
    * asynchronously and after an artificial delay, hence `mapAsync` is used. Typical real-world
    * examples for such stages are calls to external services (e.g. via HTTP or gRPC) or interacting
    * with actors in a request-response way (via the ask pattern).
    *
    * The value 1 for the `parallelism` of `mapAsync` is chosen for demonstration purposes only: it
    * allows for easily showing the effect of backpressure. For real-world applications usually a
    * higher value would be suitable.
